# LocalGuide
The goal is to create a Tour Guide App which presents relevant information to a user who’s visiting your city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city. It can contain all the best known secrets that only locals know. It’s up to you which categories you want to provide, as well as what information to provide in each category. Concepts like fragments, and custom classes have been used.

There are three errors in the code, and i don't seem to be able to fix them. The errors are as follows:-
1-On pressing the back button on the phone and not the action bar back button, the app crashes.
2-Unable to add onClick action on the navigation drawer of the drawer layout.
3-Transport button does not seem to be working.
